# LLM Compatible UI Components 

Welcome! This is a library that brings you LLM compatible UI Components. 
At the moment we are building out **travel components** specifically, 
but if you have a need for others please feel free to submit a request. 

## Project Setup 
This is a React + Vite package. It's structured like a component 
playground where you can test them all out. 
To do this you'll want to set up the package locally and run it. 

Clone the package and run ``npm install`` to install all necessary 
dependencies. 

Then run the package using `npm run dev` and follow the URL that is returned.

## Contribution Guidelines 
Keep it clean! Run `npm run lint` to check for any formatting errors
before commiting to mainline.
